#  My First HTML Website

This project marks my first step into frontend development. As a data scientist, I’m used to working with Python, building models, and exploring data — but I wanted to try something new. So I decided to challenge myself by creating a simple website using HTML.

##  Why I Started
I’ve always been curious about how websites are built from scratch. With a strong foundation in Python, I wanted to expand my skill set and understand the basics of web development before moving on to frameworks like React. This project is my starting point.

##  What I Learned
- Basic HTML structure  
- How to display text, images, and links  
- How to organize a webpage  
- How frontend development differs from data science  

##  Goals Moving Forward
- Improve the design with CSS  
- Add interactivity with JavaScript  
- Transition into learning React  
- Build a cleaner, more responsive personal portfolio  

##  Feedback
This is my first attempt at building a website, so feedback is welcome!  
Feel free to open an issue or leave a comment. I’m learning and improving as I go.
