<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a data scientist who genuinely loves the thrill of building models, making predictions, and staying plugged into the fast-evolving data science ecosystem. 
  Nothing excites me more than turning raw data into insights that actually make sense,it feels like solving a puzzle every single day. 
  I’ve built models, tested ideas, broken things, fixed them, and learned along the way, and honestly, 
  I enjoy every part of the process</p>

<p>One day I thought to myself, “Why not try building a website?” It couldn’t be that hard, right? I mean, 
  I already speak Python fluently confidently enough to say that if Python were a language, 
  I’d be writing poetry by now. So with that audacity, 
  I decided to step into the world of web development just to see what I could create outside my usual data science toolkit.</p>

<p>So I started with HTML my very first time, actually ,just to play around and get a feel for things before moving on to the real work like 
  Javascript,React and other advanced tools. How did I do? Well, you’re the judge of that.
   I’m open to feedback, improvements, and ideas. Every new skill starts with a first line of code, 
   and this little experiment might just be the beginning of something bigger</p>
